For testing API you can download Postman or another such an analogue. There are test data that you can use.
Thereâ€™s one user already registered with USER and APICALL roles (login = "nick", password = "1234") and two users with USER role (login = "john", password = "1234" and login = "mary", password = "1234"). All new users automatically get USER role. You can change these test data in data.sql if you want.
Also, user 'nick' has two created mails that you can manipulate with. You can change them in InjectDataController class.
All available endpoints you can see on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html. For authorization, you must add a new header, where Authorization is key and Basic token is value, where token - value that you will get after encoding string login:password into Base64.
